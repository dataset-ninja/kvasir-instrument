**Kvasir Instrument: A Gastrointestinal Instrument Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 590 images with 1240 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*instrument*).

Images in the Kvasir Instrument dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation and bounding box annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation task (only one mask for every class). All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (472 images) and *test* (118 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">NOR-SWE-UK joint research group</span>.
